# Cartpole Balancer with Deep Q-Learning

A project demonstrating the use of Deep Q-Learning to solve the classic Cartpole balancing problem using reinforcement learning techniques. The implementation leverages Jupyter Notebook for interactive development and visualization, with supporting Python modules.

## Overview

This repository contains code and notebooks to train an agent to balance a cartpole using Deep Q-Networks (DQN). The project serves as a practical introduction to reinforcement learning and neural network-based control using OpenAI Gym environments.

## Features

- Interactive Jupyter Notebook workflow
- Deep Q-Learning implementation for Cartpole-v1
- Visualization of training progress and agent performance
- Modular Python code for easy experimentation
- Hyperparameter tuning options

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/snakebit18/Cartpole-balancer-with-deep-QLearning.git
    cd Cartpole-balancer-with-deep-QLearning
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. (Optional) If requirements.txt is not present, install manually:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy torch matplotlib gym
    ```

### Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Open the notebook file (e.g., `cartpole_dqn.ipynb`) and run the cells to train and evaluate the agent.

### Repository Structure

- `cartpole_dqn.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook with training and evaluation code
- `dqn_agent.py` – Python module implementing the DQN agent
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## Results

The notebook provides visualization of the learning curve and trained agent performance, showcasing how Deep Q-Learning can solve the Cartpole environment.
